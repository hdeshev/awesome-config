Adapted from the template files, with some style reformatting and custom
keybindings. Not a whole lot of customization other than that at this point.

The "obvious" and "vicious" directories are unmodified git clones of the
libraries, as described in the awesome wiki.

Note: obvious is broken when run off master now. Use the 'master-3.4.7' branch
